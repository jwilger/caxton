# Research: Health Check Endpoint HTTP Framework

## Overview

Research into HTTP framework options for implementing the `/health` endpoint in Rust, considering the newly clarified constitutional requirements that permit third-party Rust crates while prohibiting external service dependencies.

## Key Research Questions Resolved

### 1. HTTP Framework Choice (NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved)

**Decision**: Use `axum` HTTP framework

**Rationale**:

- Constitutional compliance: No external services required, uses only Rust crates
- Type safety: Excellent compile-time guarantees aligned with Constitutional Principle III
- Performance: Async-first design easily meets sub-100ms response requirement
- Future platform growth: Robust foundation for expanding Caxton server capabilities
- Ecosystem: Strong community support and active development

**Alternatives Considered**:

- `std::net`: Constitutional compliant but unnecessary development overhead
- `hyper`: Lower-level, more complex API for simple health check needs
- `warp`: Good type safety but steeper learning curve than axum
- `actix-web`: Mature but heavier dependency tree than needed

### 2. Dependency Strategy

**Decision**: Minimal axum setup with core dependencies only

**Rationale**:

- Core axum crates provide routing, JSON serialization, and HTTP handling
- Tokio runtime required for async operation (standard in Rust ecosystem)
- Serde for JSON serialization (universal Rust pattern)
- No external services: purely in-process HTTP server

**Dependencies Identified**:

- `axum` - Core HTTP framework
- `tokio` - Async runtime
- `serde` - JSON serialization
- `serde_json` - JSON format support

### 3. Server Architecture

**Decision**: Embedded HTTP server within Caxton binary

**Rationale**:

- Single binary deployment: Aligns with Constitutional Principle V (no external services)
- Immediate availability: Server starts with application, no separate setup
- Resource efficiency: Shared process space with main application
- Type safety: Rust ownership system prevents common HTTP server vulnerabilities

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Separate HTTP service: Would violate single binary requirement
- CGI/FastCGI approach: Unnecessary complexity for embedded health check

### 4. Response Format Implementation

**Decision**: Structured types with JSON serialization

**Rationale**:

- Type safety: `HealthResponse` struct with `serde` derives ensures valid JSON
- Extensibility: Structured response allows future field additions
- Performance: Compile-time JSON generation, no runtime reflection
- Standards compliance: Proper Content-Type headers and HTTP status codes

**Implementation Types**:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize)]
struct HealthResponse {
    status: HealthStatus,
}

#[derive(Serialize)]
enum HealthStatus {
    #[serde(rename = "OK")]
    Ok,
}
```

### 5. Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Multi-layer testing approach

**Rationale**:

- Unit tests: Response serialization and type correctness
- Integration tests: Full HTTP request/response cycle
- Contract tests: Validate JSON schema compliance
- Performance tests: Sub-100ms response requirement validation

**Test Structure**:

- `tests/unit/health_response.rs` - Type and serialization tests
- `tests/integration/health_endpoint.rs` - HTTP endpoint tests
- `benches/health_performance.rs` - Response time benchmarks

## Technical Implementation Architecture

### HTTP Server Integration

- Axum router with `/health` route registration
- GET and HEAD method support via axum routing
- Graceful shutdown integration with main application lifecycle
- Error handling with structured JSON error responses

### Type Hierarchy

- `HealthResponse` - Primary response structure
- `HealthStatus` - Enumerated status values
- `HealthService` - Business logic encapsulation
- `HealthRouter` - HTTP route configuration

### Configuration

- Server port configuration via environment variable or CLI args
- Health endpoint path configurable (defaults to `/health`)
- Response format versioning for future API evolution

## Performance Considerations

### Response Time Target: Sub-100ms

- Axum async performance easily meets requirement
- Static response generation with minimal allocation
- Connection pooling handled by tokio runtime
- No I/O operations in health check logic

### Memory Usage

- Minimal heap allocation for static response
- Axum's zero-copy request parsing
- Structured response with compile-time size optimization

### Concurrency

- Tokio async runtime handles concurrent requests
- No shared state in health check logic
- Lock-free response generation

## Constitutional Compliance Analysis

### ✅ Zero External Service Dependencies

- No databases, vector stores, or external services required
- All functionality provided by Rust crates in single binary

### ✅ Type-Driven Safety

- All HTTP parsing handled by axum with type validation
- Response generation through typed structs with serde
- Compile-time guarantees for JSON format correctness

### ✅ Observability First

- HTTP request/response logging via axum middleware
- OpenTelemetry tracing integration planned
- Structured logging for monitoring and debugging

### ✅ Minimal Core Architecture

- Health endpoint is justified core infrastructure for monitoring
- No feature creep beyond basic availability checking

## Migration and Evolution Path

### Phase 1: Basic Implementation

- Simple `/health` endpoint with static "OK" response
- GET and HEAD method support
- Proper HTTP status codes and headers

### Phase 2: Enhanced Monitoring (Future)

- Optional dependency health checks (when services configured)
- Performance metrics in response
- Versioned API for backward compatibility

### Phase 3: Platform Integration (Future)

- Agent runtime health status
- Memory and resource utilization reporting
- Custom health check configuration via TOML

## Next Phase Inputs

For Phase 1 design:

- Axum-based HTTP server architecture
- Type-driven response structure design
- Integration testing strategy for HTTP endpoints
- Performance benchmarking approach for sub-100ms requirement
