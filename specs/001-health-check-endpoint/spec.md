# Feature Specification: Health Check Endpoint

**Feature Branch**: `001-health-check-endpoint`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "health check endpoint"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature: Basic health check endpoint for server monitoring
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Monitoring systems, load balancers, operations teams
   ’ Actions: Check server availability, return status
   ’ Data: Static health status response
   ’ Constraints: JSON format, fast response, no dependencies
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ All ambiguities resolved through clarification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary scenario: External monitor checks server health
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement is testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ HealthResponse, HealthStatus types identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

Operations teams and monitoring systems need a simple way to verify that the Caxton server is running and ready to handle requests. This endpoint provides a fast, lightweight check that confirms basic server availability without testing any dependencies or complex functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the Caxton server is running, **When** a monitoring system sends a GET request to `/health`, **Then** it receives HTTP 200 with JSON response `{"status": "OK"}`

2. **Given** the Caxton server is running, **When** a load balancer sends a HEAD request to `/health`, **Then** it receives HTTP 200 with no response body

3. **Given** the Caxton server is running, **When** any system sends a request to `/health`, **Then** the response includes `Content-Type: application/json` header and completes within 100ms

### Edge Cases

- What happens when unsupported HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE) are used? System should return appropriate method not allowed response
- How does the endpoint behave during server startup? Should be available immediately once the server starts listening
- What happens during graceful shutdown? Endpoint should remain available until server stops accepting connections

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a `/health` endpoint accessible via GET requests
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a `/health` endpoint accessible via HEAD requests
- **FR-003**: System MUST return HTTP 200 status code when server is operational
- **FR-004**: System MUST return JSON response `{"status": "OK"}` for GET requests
- **FR-005**: System MUST return empty response body for HEAD requests
- **FR-006**: System MUST include `Content-Type: application/json` header in responses
- **FR-007**: System MUST reject unsupported HTTP methods with appropriate error responses
- **FR-008**: System MUST respond to health checks within 100ms
- **FR-009**: System MUST make health endpoint available immediately after server startup
- **FR-010**: System MUST not perform any external dependency checks for this endpoint

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **HealthResponse**: Represents the health check response containing status information and proper JSON serialization
- **HealthStatus**: Represents the current health state of the server (initially just "OK" status)
