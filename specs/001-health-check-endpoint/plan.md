# Implementation Plan: Health Check Endpoint

**Branch**: `001-health-check-endpoint` | **Date**: 2025-09-22 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-health-check-endpoint/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Basic health check endpoint for monitoring server availability. Provides `/health` endpoint supporting GET and HEAD requests, returning static JSON `{"status": "OK"}` with HTTP 200 status. No external dependencies, sub-100ms response time requirement. Establishes foundational HTTP server infrastructure for Caxton platform.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Rust 2024 edition (current version)
**Primary Dependencies**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION (HTTP server framework: axum, warp, actix-web, or other)
**Storage**: N/A (static response only)
**Testing**: cargo test (standard Rust testing)
**Target Platform**: Linux server (application server platform)
**Project Type**: single (minimal core architecture per constitution)
**Performance Goals**: Sub-100ms response time for health checks
**Constraints**: Zero external dependencies (per constitution), minimal binary size
**Scale/Scope**: Foundation endpoint for multi-agent platform, must support production monitoring

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

- [x] Configuration-First Platform Design: Health endpoint is core infrastructure, not user-deployed feature
- [x] Minimal Core Architecture: Health endpoint is justified core infrastructure for monitoring
- [x] Type-Driven Safety: HTTP requests parsed at boundary, HealthResponse type ensures valid JSON
- [x] Observability First: Health endpoint will include tracing and structured logging
- [x] Zero External Service Dependencies: Axum/tokio are Rust crates, no external services required
- [x] Architectural Decision Records: HTTP framework ADR created (001-http-framework-selection.md)
- [x] Comprehensive User Documentation: Health endpoint documented for all three audiences
- [x] Professional Website Standards: Basic monitoring capability aligns with platform claims
- [x] GitHub Pull Request Workflow: Implementation will follow standard PR workflow
- [x] Pre-commit Hook Compliance: All commits will pass pre-commit hooks
- [x] Mandatory Research Agent Delegation: Research tasks will be delegated to specialized agents

**Structure Decision**: [DEFAULT to Option 1 unless Technical Context indicates web/mobile app]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

**MANDATORY AGENT DELEGATION**: ALL research MUST be delegated to specialized agents per Constitutional Principle XI.

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **REQUIRED: Delegate to specialized research agents**:

   ```
   Use documentation-expert to research: [technology/pattern questions]
   Use codebase-scanner to analyze: [existing codebase for integration points]
   Use requirements-analyst to clarify: [any ambiguous requirements]
   ```

   **CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION**: Main agent performing inline research instead of delegation.

3. **Read agent outputs** from `.claude/docs/[agent-name]-plan.md` files

4. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

**MANDATORY AGENT DELEGATION**: Design decisions MUST be delegated to specialized agents per Constitutional Principle XI.

1. **REQUIRED: Delegate design analysis to agents**:

   ```
   Use implementation-planner to explore: [feature design options based on research]
   Use test-designer to identify: [testing strategies for this feature]
   ```

2. **Read agent outputs** from `.claude/docs/[agent-name]-plan.md` files

3. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

4. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

5. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

6. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

7. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

Based on Phase 1 artifacts (data-model.md, contracts/health-api.yaml, quickstart.md):

- **Contract Tests**: Generate failing contract tests from OpenAPI spec
  - `tests/contract/health_endpoint_test.rs` - HTTP contract validation
  - Verify GET/HEAD methods, JSON response format, error codes

- **Domain Model Tasks**: Create type-safe domain types from data-model.md
  - `src/types/health.rs` - HealthResponse, HealthStatus types
  - `src/types/config.rs` - ServerConfig with nutype domain types
  - Property tests for nutype validation rules

- **HTTP Foundation Tasks**: Build extensible HTTP framework
  - `src/http/server.rs` - Axum server setup and lifecycle
  - `src/http/router.rs` - Route registration system
  - `src/http/middleware.rs` - Observability and error handling
  - `src/config/server.rs` - TOML configuration integration

- **Health Endpoint Implementation**: Make contract tests pass
  - `src/api/health.rs` - Health check handler implementation
  - Integration with HTTP server and configuration
  - Response time optimization for sub-100ms requirement

**Dependencies & Integration**:

- Add required dependencies: axum, tokio, serde, nutype, toml
- Update Cargo.toml with HTTP server dependencies
- Create integration test suite from quickstart.md examples
- Performance benchmarks for response time validation

**Ordering Strategy**:

1. **Setup Phase**: Dependencies and basic project structure
2. **Types Phase** [P]: Domain types (health, config) - parallel implementation
3. **Foundation Phase**: HTTP server infrastructure (sequential)
4. **Contract Phase** [P]: Contract tests for all endpoints - parallel test creation
5. **Implementation Phase**: Health endpoint implementation
6. **Integration Phase**: End-to-end testing and performance validation

**TDD Approach**:

- Contract tests written first (failing)
- Domain types with property tests
- HTTP infrastructure with integration tests
- Health endpoint implementation to make tests pass
- Performance benchmarks to validate sub-100ms requirement

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**Configuration Management**:

- TOML configuration integration tasks
- Environment variable override support
- Configuration validation and error handling
- Default value management with nutype guarantees

**Testing Strategy**:

- Property tests for nutype domain types
- Contract tests for API compliance
- Integration tests for HTTP server functionality
- Performance tests for response time requirements
- Load testing preparation for production readiness

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
