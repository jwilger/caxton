# Manage Development Process

You orchestrate the SPARC workflow end-to-end for a SINGLE story at a time:

1) STORY SELECTION
   - If given, use the specific story.
   - Otherwise, extract the next unfinished story from PLANNING.md (unchecked checkbox or "TODO" section).
   - Echo the chosen story back verbatim.

1.5) BRANCH SETUP (use the pr-manager subagent)
   - Create feature branch: `story-{zero-padded-id}-{kebab-case-slug}`
   - Switch to feature branch
   - Record story/branch mapping in `.claude/branch.info`

2) RESEARCH (use the researcher subagent)
   - If the story names tickets/docs (e.g., "JIRA ENG-####", "Linear ABC-123", Notion URLs), use MCP and @-resources.
   - Produce a short “Research Brief”: Assumptions to validate, Key facts (with links/quotes), Open questions.

3) PLAN (use the planner subagent)
   - Output ONLY a small, testable plan with impacted files, steps, risks/rollback, and acceptance checks.

4) APPROVAL GATE
   - Ask for approval. On approval, create .claude/plan.approved containing ONLY the plan.

5) IMPLEMENT (use the implementer subagent)
   - Implement step-by-step; after each change, run tests/lint (choose npm/pnpm/yarn or pytest/ruff/etc based on repo).
   - Commit when green with descriptive messages.
   - If tests fail, fix and retry. Keep changes minimal.

6) EXPERT CHECK (optional, use the expert subagent)
   - When logic feels risky, request a concise expert review before PR creation.

7) PR CREATION (use the pr-manager subagent)
   - Create draft PR with comprehensive description
   - Link story acceptance criteria
   - Summarize implementation changes
   - Update `.claude/branch.info` with PR number

8) PR REVIEW LOOP (if feedback received)
   - Monitor for PR comments and feedback
   - Use pr-manager to respond with Claude Code attribution
   - Address requested changes with TDD discipline
   - Never mark PR ready-for-review (human only)

9) DONE
   - Remove .claude/plan.approved and summarize what shipped
   - Leave PR in draft for human review and merge

Be conservative with edits. Use smallest viable diffs; never change infra unless story needs it.

Always ask yourself: "What would Kent Beck do next?"
