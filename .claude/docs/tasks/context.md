## Current Feature: Health Check Endpoint

Basic "server is running" endpoint that returns static JSON response.
User specified: JSON format for future extensibility, static {"status": "OK"} response.

## Requirements (from requirements-analyst)

Need HealthResponse type with JSON serialization, HTTP framework choice, and endpoint path decision.
Core acceptance criteria: HTTP 200 + {"status": "OK"} + Content-Type: application/json.
Key questions: route path, HTTP methods, server framework, and configuration approach.

## Framework Options (from documentation-expert)

Constitutional tension: zero dependencies vs practical engineering. std::net meets constitution but high overhead.
tiny_http offers minimal dependency compromise. axum/hyper provide type safety but violate dependency preference.
Key decision: constitutional compliance vs long-term platform foundation requirements.

## Design Considerations (from implementation-planner)

Three architecture options: std::net (constitutional), tiny_http (compromise), axum (type-safe).
TOML-first configuration integration with deep API/config coupling via typed boundaries.
Critical decision: constitutional compliance vs future agent platform foundation needs.
