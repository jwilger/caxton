# Requirements Analysis: Basic Health Check Endpoint

## Executive Summary

User wants a basic health check endpoint that returns static JSON indicating the server is running. This is a foundational endpoint for monitoring and load balancing that confirms server availability without checking external dependencies. The endpoint should return {"status": "OK"} in JSON format to enable future extensibility while keeping current implementation minimal.

## Domain Model Concepts

### Core Types Needed

- **HealthStatus**: Enum representing server health states (initially just `OK`)
- **HealthResponse**: Structured response containing status and potentially metadata
- **EndpointPath**: Type-safe representation of the health check route
- **HttpResponse**: Proper HTTP response with correct headers and status codes

### Business Rules

- Health check MUST always return HTTP 200 when server is accessible
- Response MUST be valid JSON format
- Response MUST include "status" field with string value
- Endpoint MUST be accessible without authentication
- Response time SHOULD be minimal (no dependency checks)

### State Machines

- Server states: Running (returns OK) | Unreachable (no response)
- Health endpoint states: Available | Not Found | Error

## Parse Boundaries

- HTTP request parsing: Incoming request -> Route matching
- Response serialization: HealthResponse -> JSON string -> HTTP response
- Content-Type header: Must be "application/json"

## Workflows

- **Health Check Request**: HttpRequest -> RouteMatch -> HealthResponse -> JsonResponse
- **Server Startup**: Initialize -> Register health route -> Ready to serve
- **Monitoring Integration**: External monitor -> HTTP GET -> Parse JSON -> Health status

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- Given server is running, when GET request sent to health endpoint, then returns HTTP 200 with {"status": "OK"}
- Given any HTTP method other than GET, when sent to health endpoint, then returns appropriate HTTP method error
- Given malformed request to health endpoint, when processed, then returns valid JSON error response
- Given server is running, when health endpoint called, then response includes Content-Type: application/json header

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Response time MUST be under 100ms for health checks
- Endpoint MUST not perform any database or external service calls
- Response format MUST be consistent across all calls
- Endpoint MUST be available immediately after server startup

### Error Handling

- System prevents health endpoint from becoming unavailable during normal operation
- Parser ensures only valid JSON responses are returned
- Route handler rejects unsupported HTTP methods gracefully

## Questions for User

1. **Route Path**: What should the endpoint path be? Common patterns are `/health`, `/health/check`, `/healthz`, or `/api/health`?

2. **HTTP Methods**: Should the endpoint support only GET, or also HEAD for monitoring tools that just check status codes?

3. **Response Format**: The current spec is minimal. Should we include any additional fields like:
   - Timestamp of the check?
   - Server version or build info?
   - Request ID for debugging?

4. **Error Scenarios**: How should the endpoint behave during graceful shutdown? Should it return a different status or become unavailable?

5. **Server Framework**: What HTTP server framework should this use? The current codebase is minimal - are there preferences for dependencies like axum, warp, actix-web, etc.?

6. **Port Configuration**: What port should the server listen on? Should this be configurable via environment variable or command line?

## Starting Points

### Implementation Order

1. **Begin with HTTP server framework decision** - This affects all subsequent type choices
2. **Core type to establish first**: HealthResponse struct with proper JSON serialization
3. **Route definition**: Type-safe route handler that returns the HealthResponse
4. **Integration test**: End-to-end test hitting the actual HTTP endpoint

### Riskiest Assumptions to Validate

1. **Framework choice**: The HTTP server framework affects type design and testing approach
2. **JSON serialization**: Ensuring consistent JSON output format across different scenarios
3. **Port and configuration**: How server startup and configuration will work
4. **Performance expectations**: Whether sub-100ms response time is achievable with chosen framework

### Parse Boundary Priority

1. **HTTP request -> Route matching** (framework handles this)
2. **HealthResponse -> JSON serialization** (custom type with serde)
3. **Configuration -> Server binding** (port, address configuration)

## Technical Considerations

### Type Safety Opportunities

- Use newtype pattern for endpoint paths to prevent routing errors
- Enum for health statuses to make invalid states unrepresentable
- Structured response type to ensure consistent JSON format

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for response serialization
- Integration tests for HTTP endpoint behavior
- Property tests for JSON format consistency
- Performance tests for response time requirements

### Future Extensibility

- Response structure allows adding fields without breaking clients
- Health status enum can be extended (Warning, Critical, etc.)
- Endpoint can evolve to include dependency checks
- Monitoring metadata can be added to response structure
