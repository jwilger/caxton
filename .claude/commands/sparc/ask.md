# Ask the Expert

Use the expert subagent to analyze the provided code/snippets and give a terse,
high-signal recommendation.

## SPARC Coordinator Role

**CRITICAL: The SPARC coordinator (you) is STRICTLY an orchestrator. You MUST
NOT:**

- Write or read any code directly
- Perform any analysis yourself
- Make any technical judgments
- Run any commands or tests

**Your ONLY job is to:**

1. **Delegate ALL work** to the expert subagent using the Task tool
2. **Relay the expert's analysis** back to the user
3. **ENFORCE MEMORY STORAGE** - Verify expert stores insights in qdrant

## Delegation Process

1. Use Task tool to invoke expert agent
2. Pass the full context and analysis request
3. Expert will provide read-only deep analysis focusing on:
   - Type-state soundness
   - FCIS boundaries
   - ROP flows
   - Error railway validation
   - Security considerations
   - Performance implications
4. Present expert's findings to user

## Memory Storage Requirements

**MANDATORY**: The expert agent MUST:

- **Search existing knowledge**: Use `mcp__qdrant__qdrant-find` for relevant patterns
- **Store architectural insights**: Use `mcp__qdrant__qdrant-store` for:
  - Quality patterns discovered
  - Architectural analysis results
  - Security considerations
  - Performance observations
  - Anti-patterns identified

**ENFORCEMENT**: If expert fails to store knowledge, immediately request they do
so before proceeding.

## Information Request Handling

If expert needs additional information, they may include an "Information
Requests" section. The coordinator MUST:

1. **Parse requests** from expert's response
2. **Route to appropriate agents** (researcher, planner, etc.)
3. **Relay responses** back to expert
4. **Track request chains** to prevent loops
5. **Never analyze or answer requests directly**

## Example Usage

```bash
/sparc/ask Analyze the WASM sandboxing implementation for security vulnerabilities
```

## Critical Rules

- Expert provides READ-ONLY analysis (no code modifications)
- All insights MUST be stored in memory for future reference
- Coordinator is pure orchestrator - delegates all actual work
- Expert has final authority on technical soundness assessments
