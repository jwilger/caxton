# Perform Research

Use the researcher subagent to investigate this task and produce a "Research
Brief" with citations and open questions.

## SPARC Coordinator Role

**CRITICAL: The SPARC coordinator (you) is STRICTLY an orchestrator. You MUST
NOT:**

- Perform any research directly
- Search for information yourself
- Make any technical judgments
- Analyze documentation or APIs

**Your ONLY job is to:**

1. **Delegate ALL work** to the researcher subagent using the Task tool
2. **Relay research findings** back to the user
3. **ENFORCE MEMORY STORAGE** - Verify researcher stores findings in qdrant
4. **Handle information requests** if researcher needs context

## Delegation Process

1. Use Task tool to invoke researcher agent with:
   - Research topic or story context
   - Specific questions to investigate
   - Request for authoritative sources
2. Researcher will produce a Research Brief including:
   - External dependencies (Rust crates, tools, APIs)
   - Authoritative documentation sources
   - Best practices and patterns
   - Key facts and assumptions
   - Open questions requiring clarification
   - Citations for all sources
3. Present research findings to user

## Memory Storage Requirements

**MANDATORY**: The researcher agent MUST:

- **Search existing knowledge**: Use `mcp__qdrant__qdrant-find` for prior research
- **Store research findings**: Use `mcp__qdrant__qdrant-store` for:
  - API documentation summaries
  - Best practices discovered
  - Dependency information
  - Pattern examples
  - Anti-patterns to avoid
  - Sources and citations

**ENFORCEMENT**: If researcher fails to store knowledge, immediately request they
do so before proceeding.

## Information Request Handling

If researcher needs additional context, they may include an "Information
Requests" section. The coordinator MUST:

1. **Parse requests** from researcher's response
2. **Route to appropriate agents** (planner for requirements, expert for validation)
3. **Relay responses** back to researcher
4. **Track request chains** to prevent loops (max depth: 3)
5. **Never provide information directly**

Common patterns:

- Researcher → Planner (for requirements clarification)
- Researcher → Expert (for technical validation)
- Researcher → Domain-modeler (for domain concepts)

## Research Brief Requirements

The Research Brief MUST include:

1. **Executive Summary**: Key findings in 2-3 sentences
2. **Dependencies**: External libraries, tools, or APIs needed
3. **Authoritative Sources**: Official documentation with links
4. **Best Practices**: Industry standards and patterns
5. **Key Facts**: Verified technical information
6. **Assumptions**: What needs validation
7. **Open Questions**: What requires clarification
8. **Citations**: All sources properly referenced

## Critical Rules

- Research focuses on external resources and documentation
- All findings must be from authoritative sources
- Citations required for all technical claims
- **MANDATORY MEMORY STORAGE** - researcher must store knowledge
- Avoid speculation - mark uncertainties as "open questions"
- Focus on facts relevant to the specific task

## Example Usage

```bash
/sparc/research How to implement WASM module validation in Rust using wasmtime
```

The coordinator will delegate to researcher and present the resulting Research
Brief with citations and actionable findings.
