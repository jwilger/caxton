# Respond to PR Review

Use the pr-manager subagent to address PR feedback and respond to review comments.

## Process

1. Read all comments on the PR
2. Analyze requested changes
3. Create plan for addressing feedback
4. Implement changes using TDD discipline
5. Respond to comments with Claude Code attribution
6. Update PR description if needed

## Comment Response Format

All responses to PR comments MUST use this format:

```markdown
<!-- Generated by Claude Code -->
**ðŸ¤– Claude Code**: {Your response addressing the specific comment}

{If making code changes, explain what you're doing and why}

*This comment was generated automatically by Claude Code on behalf of the repository maintainer. Please direct questions about this automation to the repository owner.*
```

## Change Implementation

For code changes requested in reviews:
1. Create `.claude/tdd.red` for failing test
2. Implement minimal fix
3. Run full test suite
4. Create focused commit with descriptive message
5. Push changes and update PR comments

## Safety Guidelines

- Never mark PR as ready-for-review
- Always attribute responses to Claude Code
- Make minimal, focused changes only
- Verify all tests pass before responding
- Ask for clarification on ambiguous feedback

## Example Usage

```
/sparc:review 42
```
or
```
/sparc:review  # uses current branch PR
```
