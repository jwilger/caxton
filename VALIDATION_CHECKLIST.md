  ```

- [ ] Verify no critical assets were lost in removal
- [ ] Clean up any system files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`)

#### Content Consolidation

- [ ] Compare and merge duplicate files:

  - `/docs/contributors/testing.md` vs `/docs/audiences/contributors/testing-guide.md`
- [ ] Move root-level docs to appropriate sections:
  - `README.md` â†’ integrate with main documentation index
  - `TESTING.md` â†’ merge with contributor testing guide
  - `type_system_improvements_report.md` â†’ move to contributors section
  - `domain-types.md` â†’ integrate with developer guide

#### Directory Cleanup

- [ ] Remove empty directories after file cleanup
- [ ] Consolidate `/docs/contributors/` into `/docs/audiences/contributors/`

#### Navigation Testing

- [ ] Verify all navigation links are functional
- [ ] Test mobile responsive navigation
- [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation accessibility
- [ ] Validate aria labels and screen reader support

### ðŸ”„ Phase 4: Link Validation (CRITICAL)

#### Automated Link Checking

- [ ] Run link checker on entire documentation set

  ```bash
  # Install link checker if needed
  npm install -g markdown-link-check

  # Check all markdown files
  find /home/jwilger/projects/caxton/docs -name "*.md" -exec markdown-link-check {} \;
  find /home/jwilger/projects/caxton/website -name "*.md" -exec markdown-link-check {} \;
  ```

#### Manual Link Updates Required

- [ ] Update ADR cross-references for new Jekyll collection format
- [ ] Fix getting-started guide internal links
- [ ] Update API documentation cross-references
- [ ] Verify external links are still accessible

#### Specific Link Patterns to Update

- [ ] `../adr/XXXX-title.md` â†’ `/adr/XXXX-title/` (Jekyll format)
- [ ] `../api/filename.md` â†’ `/docs/api/filename/` (documentation format)
- [ ] `../getting-started/filename.md` â†’ `/docs/getting-started/filename/`
- [ ] Relative image paths to absolute paths where needed

### ðŸ”„ Phase 5: Jekyll Site Validation (BEFORE DEPLOYMENT)

#### Build Testing

- [ ] Jekyll site builds without errors

  ```bash
  cd /home/jwilger/projects/caxton/website
  bundle install
  bundle exec jekyll build
  ```

- [ ] No broken internal links in build output
- [ ] All collections render correctly
- [ ] CSS and JavaScript assets load properly

#### Content Validation

- [ ] Search functionality returns relevant results
- [ ] Mobile responsive design works across device sizes

#### Performance Validation

- [ ] Site builds in reasonable time (<2 minutes)
- [ ] Page load times acceptable (<3 seconds)
- [ ] Search index builds correctly
- [ ] Images optimized for web delivery

### ðŸ”„ Phase 6: User Experience Testing

#### Navigation Flow Testing

- [ ] Clear path from homepage to all major sections
- [ ] Logical progression through getting-started guides
- [ ] Easy discovery of audience-specific documentation
- [ ] Intuitive ADR browsing experience

#### Content Accessibility Testing

- [ ] All headings follow proper hierarchy (h1 â†’ h2 â†’ h3)
- [ ] Alt text provided for all images
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- [ ] Keyboard navigation fully functional

#### Cross-Browser Testing

- [ ] Functionality verified in Chrome
- [ ] Functionality verified in Firefox
- [ ] Functionality verified in Safari
- [ ] Mobile browser testing completed

## Deployment Validation

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All cleanup tasks completed successfully
- [ ] Zero broken internal links confirmed
- [ ] Jekyll site builds without warnings
- [ ] Navigation structure fully functional
- [ ] Search functionality operational

### Deployment Process

- [ ] Create deployment branch from current state
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment first
- [ ] Perform full site testing on staging
- [ ] Document any issues found during staging
- [ ] Address issues before production deployment

### Post-Deployment Validation

- [ ] Verify site loads correctly on GitHub Pages
- [ ] Test all navigation paths work in production
- [ ] Confirm search functionality works on live site
- [ ] Monitor for any 404 errors in logs
- [ ] Validate external links still work from production

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Found

- [ ] Document specific issues encountered
- [ ] Determine if issues are fixable quickly (< 30 minutes)
- [ ] If not quickly fixable, rollback to previous version
- [ ] Create issues for problems to address later
- [ ] Plan remediation timeline

### Rollback Steps

1. Revert to previous git commit/branch
2. Redeploy previous version to production
3. Update team on rollback status
4. Schedule fix implementation
5. Plan re-deployment after fixes

## Success Criteria
