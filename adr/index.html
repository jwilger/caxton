<h1>Architecture Decision Records</h1>

<p>This project uses Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions. ADRs help future developers understand not just what decisions were made, but why they were made and what alternatives were considered.</p>

<div id="empty-state" class="empty-state" style="display: none;">

<!-- ADR cards are now generated by the adr-index layout template only -->
<!-- This removes the duplicate cards issue -->
