# Caxton Development Roadmap

Our roadmap outlines the strategic development phases for Caxton's multi-agent
isolation platform, from foundational security features to enterprise-scale
production capabilities.

</div>

## Overview

Caxton's development follows a three-phase approach, each building upon the
previous phase's foundations while introducing new capabilities and expanding
the platform's scope.

### Development Philosophy

- **Security First**: Every feature is designed with isolation and security as
  primary concerns
- **Incremental Delivery**: Each phase delivers tangible value while preparing
  for future capabilities
- **Production Ready**: Focus on reliability, performance, and enterprise-grade
  features
- **Open Source**: Transparent development with community input and
  contributions

## Phase Details

### V1.0 Isolation Core (Q1 2025)

### Target Completion: March 2025 | Progress: 75%

The foundation phase establishes core isolation mechanisms and security
frameworks that will underpin all future development.

#### Key Features

- **Container-Based Isolation**: Robust sandboxing for agent execution
  environments
- **Resource Constraints**: CPU, memory, and I/O limitations per agent instance
- **Process Sandboxing**: Operating system-level isolation and permission
  management
- **Basic Monitoring**: Essential logging and resource usage tracking
- **Security Framework**: Authentication, authorization, and audit logging

#### Milestones

- [x] Container Isolation Foundation
- [x] Process Sandboxing
- [x] Resource Constraints
- [ ] Security Framework
- [ ] Basic Monitoring

#### Technical Deliverables

- Core isolation engine with container orchestration
- Security policy enforcement system
- Resource management and quotas
- Basic observability and logging infrastructure
- API foundation for agent lifecycle management

### V2.0 Heterogeneous Agents (Q3 2025)

### Target Completion: September 2025 | Progress: 25%

This phase expands Caxton's capabilities to support diverse agent types and
sophisticated orchestration patterns.

#### Key Features

- **Multi-Language Support**: Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, and custom runtime
  support
- **Agent Communication Protocol**: Secure inter-agent messaging and data
  exchange
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatic scaling based on workload and resource
  availability
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Linux, macOS, and Windows deployment support
- **Performance Optimization**: Enhanced resource utilization and execution
  efficiency

#### Milestones

- [ ] Multi-Language Support
- [ ] Agent Communication Protocol
- [ ] Dynamic Scaling
- [ ] Cross-Platform Compatibility
- [ ] Performance Optimization

#### Technical Deliverables

- Multi-runtime execution engine
- Inter-agent communication framework
- Auto-scaling orchestrator
- Cross-platform deployment tools
- Performance monitoring and optimization tools

### V3.0 Production Scale (Q1 2026)

### Target Completion: March 2026 | Progress: 5%

The final phase transforms Caxton into an enterprise-ready platform with
advanced features for production deployments.

#### Key Features

- **Enterprise Features**: Role-based access control, audit trails, compliance
  reporting
- **Advanced Analytics**: Comprehensive performance metrics and business
  intelligence
- **High Availability**: Clustering, failover, and disaster recovery
  capabilities
- **Auto-scaling Infrastructure**: Kubernetes integration and cloud-native
  deployment
- **Production Hardening**: Security enhancements, performance tuning, and
  stability improvements

#### Milestones

- [ ] Enterprise Features
- [ ] Advanced Analytics
- [ ] High Availability
- [ ] Auto-scaling Infrastructure
- [ ] Production Hardening

#### Technical Deliverables

- Enterprise management console
- Analytics and reporting dashboard
- High availability clustering
- Kubernetes operators and helm charts
- Production deployment guides and tools
