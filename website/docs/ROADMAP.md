Our roadmap outlines the strategic development of Caxton's configuration-driven
agent platform, from rapid agent development to production-scale deployments
with embedded memory and zero external dependencies.

## Overview

Caxton's development follows a three-phase approach, each building upon the
previous phase's foundations while introducing new capabilities and expanding
the platform's scope.

### Development Philosophy

- **Configuration First**: 5-10 minute onboarding with markdown agents as the
  primary experience
- **Zero Dependencies**: Embedded memory and single-binary deployment
  eliminate infrastructure complexity
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Config agents for rapid development, WebAssembly
  for power users
- **Production Ready**: Scale from embedded to external backends without
  architectural changes
- **Open Source**: Community-driven development with transparent
  decision-making

## Phase Details

### V1.0 Configuration-First Core (Q1 2025)

### Target Completion: March 2025 | Progress: 15%

The foundation phase delivers the configuration-driven agent experience with
embedded memory and zero external dependencies.

#### Key Features

- **Configuration Agents**: Markdown + YAML agent definition with 5-10
  minute onboarding
- **Embedded Memory**: SQLite + local embedding models (All-MiniLM-L6-v2)
  for zero-config memory
- **Capability-Based Routing**: Agents request capabilities, not specific
  agents
- **Lightweight FIPA-ACL**: Simplified messaging optimized for configuration
  agents
- **Single Binary Deployment**: No external dependencies, works immediately
  out of the box

#### Milestones

- [ ] Configuration Agent Runtime
- [ ] Embedded Memory System (SQLite + Candle)
- [ ] Capability-Based Message Router
- [ ] Agent Lifecycle Management
- [ ] Basic Observability

#### Technical Deliverables

- Configuration agent execution runtime with LLM orchestration
- Embedded memory backend with semantic search
- Capability registry and routing engine
- Agent deployment and hot-reload capabilities
- Basic logging and metrics with OpenTelemetry

### V2.0 Hybrid Architecture (Q3 2025)

### Target Completion: September 2025 | Progress: 5%

This phase adds WebAssembly agent support and advanced features while
maintaining the configuration-first experience.

#### Key Features

- **WebAssembly Agent Support**: Compiled agents for custom algorithms and
  maximum performance
- **Advanced Memory Features**: Graph traversal algorithms, temporal tracking,
  confidence decay
- **External Backend Support**: Neo4j and Qdrant backends for large-scale deployments
- **Advanced Messaging**: Contract Net Protocol, subscription patterns,
  cross-instance routing
- **Developer Experience**: Hot-reload development, agent templates, migration utilities

#### Milestones

- [ ] WebAssembly Runtime Integration
- [ ] External Memory Backends
- [ ] Advanced FIPA-ACL Features
- [ ] Developer Tooling
- [ ] Performance Optimization

#### Technical Deliverables

- WebAssembly sandbox runtime with security isolation
- Neo4j and Qdrant backend implementations
- Contract Net Protocol and advanced negotiation patterns
- Agent template library and development tools
- Performance monitoring and auto-scaling capabilities

### V3.0 Enterprise Scale (Q1 2026)

### Target Completion: March 2026 | Progress: 0%

The final phase delivers enterprise-grade features while preserving the
configuration-first development experience.

#### Key Features

- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Isolated workspaces with shared infrastructure efficiency
- **Enterprise Memory**: Advanced analytics, compliance, and audit capabilities
- **Cloud-Native Deployment**: Kubernetes operators, auto-scaling, high availability
- **Marketplace Integration**: Agent template marketplace, community sharing, certification
- **Advanced Security**: RBAC, audit trails, compliance reporting, enterprise SSO

#### Milestones

- [ ] Multi-Tenant Architecture
- [ ] Enterprise Memory Analytics
- [ ] Cloud-Native Operations
- [ ] Agent Marketplace
- [ ] Enterprise Security

#### Technical Deliverables

- Multi-tenant workspace isolation and resource management
- Business intelligence dashboard with memory analytics
- Kubernetes operators and helm charts with auto-scaling
- Community marketplace with agent template sharing
- Enterprise security framework with audit and compliance

## Technical Architecture Evolution
