## v0.8 MVP Implementation Plan

### Dependencies and Critical Path

**Sequential Dependencies (must be completed in order):**

1. **STORY-001** ‚Üí **STORY-002**: CLI must exist before server can be managed
2. **STORY-002** ‚Üí **STORY-003**: Server must run before agents can be created
3. **STORY-003** ‚Üí **STORY-004**: Agent creation needs TOML parsing
4. **STORY-004** ‚Üí **STORY-041** ‚Üí **STORY-042**: Configuration parsing
   enables LLM integration
5. **STORY-042** ‚Üí **STORY-005**: LLM provider needed for agent runtime
6. **STORY-005** ‚Üí **STORY-008**: Runtime enables API management operations

**Parallel Development Opportunities:**

- Stories 001-002 can be developed by different developers
- Stories 041-042 (LLM integration) can be developed in parallel with 001-004
- Story 008 (REST API) can begin once 003 (agent creation) is defined

### 2-Week Sprint Breakdown

#### Week 1 (Sprint 1): Foundation Infrastructure

**Goal**: Get basic server and agent creation working

- **Days 1-2**: STORY-001 (CLI Foundation) + STORY-002 (Server Lifecycle)
- **Days 3-4**: STORY-003 (Agent Creation) + STORY-004 (TOML Parsing)
- **Days 5**: STORY-041 (LLM Provider Abstraction)

**Week 1 Milestone**: `caxton server start` works, agents can be created
from TOML files

#### Week 2 (Sprint 2): LLM Integration and API

**Goal**: Complete end-to-end agent interaction experience

- **Days 6-7**: STORY-042 (OpenAI Integration)
- **Days 8-9**: STORY-005 (Agent Runtime Environment)
- **Day 10**: STORY-008 (REST API for Management)

**Week 2 Milestone**: Complete 5-10 minute tutorial works end-to-end

### What's Deferred to v1.0

**MCP Tool Integration (Stories 020, 044)**:

- Deferred because v0.8 focuses on basic LLM chat functionality
- MCP tools add complexity that's not essential for initial validation
- Can be added in v1.0 without breaking existing agent configurations

**Memory System (Story 007)**:

- v0.8 uses simple in-memory storage that resets on restart
- SQLite persistence adds database management complexity
- Deferred until core functionality is proven

**Message Routing (Story 006)**:

- v0.8 supports single-agent interactions via API
- Multi-agent communication deferred until MCP integration is complete
- Direct agent addressing sufficient for initial use cases

**Monitoring & Recovery (Stories 009, 010)**:

- Basic error handling included in core stories
- Comprehensive monitoring deferred until production readiness phase
- v0.8 focuses on happy path demonstration

## Development Approach

### Type-Driven Development (Scott Wlaschin Principles)

- **Make illegal states unrepresentable** through Rust's type system
- **Parse, don't validate** - transform data at boundaries into domain types
- **Domain primitives with nutype** to eliminate primitive obsession
- **Phantom types for state machines** to enforce valid transitions
- **Smart constructors** to ensure only valid data can exist

### Test-Driven Development (Kent Beck Discipline)

- **Red-Green-Refactor** cycles for all new functionality
- **Failing tests first** that capture behavioral requirements
- **Minimal implementation** to make tests pass
- **Refactoring** to improve code structure while preserving behavior

### Memory-Enhanced Development

- **Knowledge accumulation** using memento memory tools
- **Pattern storage** for architectural decisions and solutions
- **Context awareness** across development sessions
- **Learning from mistakes** to avoid repeated errors

### Quality Gates

- **No allow attributes** - fix clippy warnings, don't suppress them
- **Domain types** for all business concepts using nutype validation
- **Comprehensive error handling** with domain-specific error types
- **Observable operations** with tracing and structured logging

## Implementation Philosophy

### Configuration-First Architecture (ADR-0028)

- **Primary experience**: TOML configuration files create agents in 5-10 minutes
- **Secondary option**: WebAssembly for advanced/performance-critical use cases
- **Development velocity**: Edit-save-test cycles without compilation
- **Community sharing**: Text-based, version-controllable agent definitions

### Zero Dependencies by Default (ADR-0030)

- **Embedded SQLite + Candle**: Works immediately without setup
- **All-MiniLM-L6-v2 model**: Automatic download and initialization
- **Pluggable backends**: Neo4j/Qdrant available for scaling beyond 100K+
  entities
- **Single binary deployment**: No external infrastructure required

### Hybrid Security Model (ADR-0002 + ADR-0005)

- **Configuration agents**: Run in host runtime with LLM orchestration
- **MCP servers**: WebAssembly sandboxes for actual system operations
- **Security boundary**: Isolation where it matters most (tool execution)
- **Rapid development**: Minimal friction for most common use cases
