## Overview

This section contains the foundational concepts necessary to understand, deploy,
and extend Caxton's multi-agent orchestration platform. Content is organized
by concept domain and structured for progressive learning from basic principles
to advanced implementations.

## Concept Domains

### Architecture Concepts

Core architectural principles and design patterns that shape how Caxton
operates as a production-ready multi-agent system.

**[Architecture](/docs/concepts/architecture/)**

- System design principles and hybrid agent architecture
- Component interactions and runtime behavior
- Domain modeling patterns and type safety approaches
- Performance characteristics and scalability patterns

### Memory System Concepts

Understanding how Caxton agents store, retrieve, and share knowledge through
the embedded and external memory backends.

**[Memory System](/docs/concepts/memory-system/)**

- Entity-relationship memory model and semantic search
- Embedded SQLite+Candle vs external backend trade-offs
- Memory scopes (agent-only, workspace, global)
- Migration patterns and data portability approaches

### Messaging Concepts

Capability-based agent messaging with routing that enables
agent-to-agent communication patterns.

**[Messaging](/docs/concepts/messaging/)**

- Capability routing vs direct agent addressing
- Agent messaging subset for production use cases
- Conversation management and multi-turn dialogue
- Integration patterns for configuration vs WASM agents

### API Concepts

REST API patterns, configuration validation, and integration approaches for
building on top of Caxton's platform.

**[API](/docs/concepts/api/)**

- Management API patterns and authentication approaches
- Configuration agent specification and validation
- MCP tool integration and capability registration
- Performance specifications and monitoring integration

## Contributing to Concepts

When adding or updating concept documentation:

1. **Progressive Complexity**: Structure from basic principles to advanced
   patterns
2. **Cross-Audience**: Include perspectives for all four audience types
3. **Concept Focus**: Explain _what_ and _why_ before _how_
4. **Perfect Formatting**: 80-character lines, proper headings, code block
   languages
5. **Jekyll Metadata**: Include proper frontmatter with concept classification

See [Documentation Standards](/docs/contributing/documentation-standards.md)
for detailed formatting and style guidelines.
