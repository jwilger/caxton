## What is Capability Registration?

Capability registration transforms how agents communicate by shifting from
**direct addressing** ("send this to Agent-47") to **capability-based
addressing** ("send this to whoever can analyze data"). This fundamental
concept enables true service-oriented architecture in multi-agent systems.

### Real-World Analogy

Think of capability registration like a **professional services directory**:

- **Traditional approach**: Calling a specific lawyer by name
- **Capability approach**: Calling "whoever handles patent law"
- **System benefit**: Automatic routing to available, qualified professionals

### Core Problem Solved

**The Agent Coordination Challenge**: In complex multi-agent systems, agents
shouldn't need to know the specific identities of every other agent.
Instead, they should express **what they need** and let the system find
**who can provide it**.

## Fundamental Concepts

### 1. Capability vs Agent Identity

**Capability**: A named service or functionality (`data-analysis`,
`image-processing`, `web-search`)

**Provider**: An agent that declares it can handle requests for specific
capabilities

**Consumer**: An agent that sends requests to capabilities rather than
specific agents

```text
Traditional:  Consumer → [specific agent ID] → Provider
Capability:   Consumer → [capability name] → System → Provider
```

### 2. Service Discovery Architecture

The capability system creates a **dynamic service registry** that:

- **Tracks availability**: Which agents provide which capabilities
- **Monitors health**: Whether providers are responsive and functional
- **Balances load**: Distributes requests across multiple providers
- **Handles failures**: Routes around unhealthy or overloaded agents

### 3. Decoupling Benefits

**Operational Independence**: Agents can be added, removed, or updated
without affecting consumers

**Load Distribution**: Multiple agents can provide the same capability,
enabling horizontal scaling

**Failure Resilience**: System continues operating when individual
providers fail

**Service Evolution**: Capability providers can be upgraded or replaced
transparently

## Capability Lifecycle Concepts

### Registration Phase

When an agent **declares** it can provide a capability:

```yaml
# Configuration Agent declares capabilities
capabilities:
  - data-analysis
  - report-generation
capability_metadata:
  data-analysis:
    supported_formats: ["csv", "json", "xlsx"]
    max_file_size: "10MB"
    processing_time: "fast"
```

**System Response**: The agent becomes **discoverable** for those
capabilities

### Discovery Phase

When a consumer needs a capability:

```javascript
// Instead of: sendMessage("agent-47", request)
const providers = await discoverCapability("data-analysis");
const bestProvider = selectProvider(providers, "fastest_response");
await sendMessage(bestProvider.agent_id, request);
```

### Routing Phase

The system **automatically selects** the best provider based on:

- **Priority scores**: Provider-declared preference levels
- **Current load**: How busy each provider currently is
- **Health status**: Whether providers are responding correctly
- **Performance history**: Response times and success rates

### Lifecycle Management

Providers can **update** their capability metadata, **change** their
priority, or **unregister** capabilities dynamically without system
disruption.

## Routing Strategy Concepts

### Priority-Based Routing

**Concept**: Route to the highest-priority available provider

**Use Case**: When you have preferred agents for specific tasks

**Algorithm**: `routing_score = priority × health_multiplier × (1 - load)`

### Load-Balanced Routing

**Concept**: Distribute requests evenly across all healthy providers

**Use Case**: When throughput is more important than individual performance

**Mechanism**: Weighted round-robin based on provider capacity

### Least-Loaded Routing

**Concept**: Always route to the provider with lowest current load

**Use Case**: When you want to minimize response times

**Benefit**: Prevents hot spots and overload conditions

### Fastest-Response Routing

**Concept**: Route to the provider with best historical response times

**Use Case**: When latency is critical (real-time systems)

**Measurement**: Tracks rolling average of response times

## Advanced Capability Concepts

### Capability Versioning

Providers can specify **version compatibility**:

```json
{
  "capability": "data-analysis",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "backward_compatible": ["1.5.0", "1.6.0"]
}
```

**Consumer Benefit**: Request specific capability versions or accept
backward-compatible alternatives

### Metadata-Based Routing

Providers can include **rich metadata** for intelligent routing:

```json
{
  "capability": "image-processing",
  "metadata": {
    "supported_formats": ["jpg", "png", "webp"],
    "max_resolution": "4K",
    "processing_time": "fast",
    "specializations": ["face_detection", "background_removal"]
  }
}
```

**Routing Enhancement**: Consumers can request providers with specific
metadata characteristics

### Capability Composition

**Complex Operations**: Break down complex tasks into multiple capability
requests

```javascript
// Multi-step workflow using capabilities
const preprocessed = await requestCapability("data-preprocessing", rawData);
const analyzed = await requestCapability("statistical-analysis", preprocessed);
const report = await requestCapability("report-generation", analyzed);
```

**System Benefit**: Each step can be handled by different specialized agents

## Health and Reliability Concepts

### Health Monitoring

The system continuously monitors provider health through:

**Active Health Checks**: Periodic HTTP requests to provider health endpoints

**Passive Monitoring**: Tracking success rates and response times of actual
requests

**Circuit Breaking**: Temporarily removing unhealthy providers from routing

### Performance Metrics

Capability registration tracks comprehensive performance data:

**Response Time Metrics**:

- Average response time over last 1000 requests
- 95th and 99th percentile response times
- Response time trends over time

**Load Metrics**:

- Current load score (0.0 = idle, 1.0 = overloaded)
- Concurrent active requests
- Request rate over time windows

**Reliability Metrics**:

- Success rate percentage
- Error rate trends
- Consecutive failure counts
- Uptime percentage over 24 hours

### Graceful Degradation

When providers become unavailable, the system provides:

**Automatic Failover**: Route to backup providers automatically

**Load Shedding**: Reject new requests during overload conditions

**Capability Unavailable Responses**: Clear error messages when no
providers available

## Implementation Patterns

### Automatic Registration

**Configuration agents** automatically register their declared capabilities:

```yaml
---
name: DataAnalyzer
description: "Processes CSV and JSON data files"
capabilities:
  - data-analysis
  - data-validation
capability_metadata:
  data-analysis:
    supported_formats: ["csv", "json", "xlsx"]
    max_file_size: "10MB"
---

Process data files and generate insights.
```

**System Behavior**: Agent automatically appears in capability discovery
upon startup

### Manual Registration

**External systems** can register capabilities via API:

```http
POST /api/v1/capabilities
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "agent_id": "external-python-service",
  "capability": "machine-learning",
  "priority": 90,
  "metadata": {
    "models": ["classification", "regression"],
    "frameworks": ["tensorflow", "pytorch"],
    "gpu_enabled": true
  }
}
```

### Dynamic Updates

Providers can **update their capabilities** in real-time:

```javascript
// Update capability metadata based on current system state
await updateCapability({
  registration_id: "cap-reg-abc123",
  priority: systemLoad < 0.5 ? 100 : 50, // Lower priority when busy
  metadata: {
    ...existingMetadata,
    current_load: systemLoad,
    available_memory: getAvailableMemory()
  }
});
```

## Cross-Audience Benefits

### For Developers

**Simplified Integration**: Write code against capability names instead of
managing agent instance details

**Testing Benefits**: Mock capabilities easily without complex agent setup

**Debugging**: Clear visibility into which agents handle which requests

### For Operators

**Scaling Decisions**: See capability demand patterns and provider
utilization

**Health Monitoring**: Unified view of service health across all
capabilities

**Load Balancing**: Automatic distribution without manual configuration

### For End Users

**Reliability**: Requests continue working even when individual agents fail

**Performance**: Automatic routing to fastest available providers

**Consistency**: Same capability experience regardless of which agent
handles the request

### For Stakeholders

**Business Continuity**: System resilience through provider redundancy

**Cost Optimization**: Efficient resource utilization through load
balancing

**Service Evolution**: Add new providers without disrupting existing
operations

## Common Patterns and Anti-Patterns

### Effective Patterns

**Granular Capabilities**: Define specific, focused capabilities rather
than broad ones

```text
✅ Good: "sales-data-analysis", "customer-churn-prediction"
❌ Avoid: "data-processing", "analytics"
```

**Rich Metadata**: Include detailed capability information for intelligent
routing

**Health Check Implementation**: Provide reliable health endpoints for
accurate availability detection

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Over-broad Capabilities**: Capabilities that are too generic reduce
routing effectiveness

**Static Priority**: Hardcoded priorities that don't reflect current system
state

**Missing Health Checks**: Providers without health endpoints cause routing
delays

**Capability Sprawl**: Too many similar capabilities that could be unified

## Integration with Other Systems

### Agent Messaging Integration

Capability registration works seamlessly with agent messaging:

```javascript
// Send agent message to capability instead of specific agent
const message = {
  performative: "REQUEST",
  capability: "data-analysis", // Instead of receiver: "agent-id"
  content: {
    action: "analyze_sales_data",
    data: salesDataset
  },
  conversation_id: "sales-analysis-001"
};
```

### Memory System Integration

Capability usage patterns can be stored in the memory system:

```javascript
// Store successful capability interactions for future optimization
await storeMemory({
  type: "capability_usage",
  capability: "data-analysis",
  provider: "DataAnalyzer-v2",
  performance: "excellent",
  context: "sales_reporting_workflow"
});
```

### Configuration Agent Integration

Configuration agents provide the **easiest path** to capability
registration through declarative YAML:

```yaml
---
name: ReportGenerator
capabilities:
  - report-generation
  - data-visualization
capability_metadata:
  report-generation:
    formats: ["pdf", "html", "json"]
    template_support: true
    charts: true
---

Generate comprehensive reports with charts and visualizations.
```

## Future Evolution
