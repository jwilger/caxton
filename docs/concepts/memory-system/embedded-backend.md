## What is the Embedded Backend?

The **embedded memory backend** is Caxton's default, zero-dependency solution
for agent knowledge storage that combines **SQLite** for structured data with
**Candle** for local machine learning inference. This architecture eliminates
the need for external databases or cloud services while providing professional-
grade semantic search capabilities.

Think of it as a **self-contained brain** that agents can use immediately
without any setup complexityâ€”similar to how a desktop application includes
everything it needs to run without requiring separate database installation.

## Core Architectural Concepts

### Zero-Dependency Philosophy

**The Problem**: Traditional agent platforms require complex infrastructure

- External vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant)
- Separate embedding API services (OpenAI, Cohere)
- Database administration and maintenance
- Network dependencies and failure modes

**The Solution**: Embedded architecture with local capabilities

- **SQLite**: Battle-tested embedded database (used in browsers, phones)
- **Candle**: Pure Rust ML inference (no Python dependencies)
- **Local Models**: ~23MB embedding model runs on CPU
- **Immediate Startup**: No external services to configure or wait for

This enables **5-minute deployment** vs **hours of infrastructure setup**.

### Hybrid Storage Architecture

The embedded backend combines two complementary storage approaches:

**Structured Storage (SQLite)**:

- Entities, relationships, metadata
- ACID transactions and data integrity
- Complex queries and graph traversal
- JSON support for flexible schemas

**Vector Storage (sqlite-vec extension)**:

- 384-dimensional semantic embeddings
- Cosine similarity search
- k-nearest-neighbor queries
- Efficient vector indexing

This hybrid approach provides both **exact matching** and **semantic understanding**
in a single, cohesive system.

## Technical Design Principles

### Performance Through Simplicity

Rather than complex distributed systems, the embedded backend achieves
performance through:

**Local Data Access**: No network latency for memory operations

- Semantic search: 10-50ms vs 100-500ms for external APIs
- Graph traversal: 5-20ms vs 50-200ms for external databases
- Zero network failures or timeout issues

**Optimized Data Structures**:

- SQLite Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) for concurrent access
- Vector indexes co-located with entity data
- Efficient batch processing for embeddings
- Connection pooling for multi-agent workloads

**Resource Efficiency**:

- ~200MB baseline memory usage (embedding model)
- ~2.5KB per entity including embedding vectors
- Scales to 100K+ entities before requiring external backends

### Context-Optimized Design

The embedded backend is specifically optimized for **context management**
integration (ADR-0031), prioritizing:

**Low Latency Context Retrieval**:

- <50ms target for context preparation
- Semantic search optimized for agent queries
- Graph traversal limited to 2-3 degrees for speed
- Temporal boosting for recent knowledge

**Token Budget Management**:

- Adaptive result sizing based on LLM context windows
- Provider-specific formatting (OpenAI, Anthropic, local)
- Content estimation and truncation strategies
- Smart result ranking by relevance and recency

### Scalability Through Pluggability

The embedded backend provides a **growth path** without architectural rewrites:

**Start Simple**: Single-node embedded for development and small deployments
**Scale Up**: External backends (Neo4j, Qdrant) for larger requirements
**Migrate Seamlessly**: Standard export/import maintains data continuity

This enables **linear scaling** as requirements grow, from prototype to
enterprise deployment.

## Core Components Deep Dive

### SQLite Integration Patterns

**Database Schema Design**:

```sql
-- Entities: Core knowledge items
entities(id, name, entity_type, observations, confidence, strength,
         version, created_at, updated_at, valid_from, valid_to, metadata)

-- Relations: Typed connections between entities
relations(from_entity_id, to_entity_id, relation_type, strength,
          confidence, temporal_constraints, metadata)

-- Embeddings: Vector representations for semantic search
embeddings(entity_id, embedding_blob, model_version, created_at)
```

**Why This Design**:

- **Normalized structure** prevents data duplication and inconsistency
- **Foreign key constraints** maintain referential integrity
- **Flexible metadata** (JSON) allows schema evolution without migrations
- **Temporal columns** support time-based queries and knowledge decay
- **Version tracking** enables entity evolution and change management

### Candle ML Integration

**Local Inference Architecture**:

- **No Python Dependencies**: Pure Rust implementation eliminates runtime issues
- **ONNX Model Loading**: Standard format supports multiple model types
- **CPU Optimization**: Efficient inference on commodity hardware
- **Batch Processing**: Groups text encoding for better throughput
- **Memory Management**: Controlled resource usage for embedding generation

**Model Selection Rationale (All-MiniLM-L6-v2)**:

- **Size Efficiency**: 23MB vs 500MB+ for larger models
- **Quality Balance**: 384 dimensions provide good semantic understanding
- **Speed Optimization**: ~1000 embeddings/second on modern CPUs
- **Compatibility**: Works well across different text types and domains
- **Proven Performance**: Widely used in semantic search applications

### Vector Search Implementation

**sqlite-vec Extension Benefits**:

- **Native Integration**: Vector search directly within SQLite queries
- **Performance**: Avoids data movement between separate systems
- **Consistency**: ACID properties apply to vector operations
- **Simplicity**: No separate vector database administration

**Search Algorithm**:

1. **Query Embedding**: Text query converted to 384-dimensional vector
2. **Similarity Calculation**: Cosine similarity against stored embeddings
3. **Result Ranking**: Combined semantic score with metadata factors
4. **Filtering**: Minimum similarity thresholds and result limits
5. **Context Enhancement**: Temporal boosting and relationship expansion

## Context Management Integration

### Why Context Management Matters

Modern agents need **relevant background information** to provide accurate,
helpful responses. The embedded backend serves as a primary **context source**
alongside conversation history and tool capabilities.

**Context Query Flow**:

1. **Agent Request**: User asks for help with specific capability
2. **Template Expansion**: Query template filled with request context
3. **Semantic Search**: Memory system finds related patterns/solutions
4. **Graph Expansion**: Relationships add connected knowledge
5. **Result Formatting**: Context adapted for specific LLM provider
6. **Token Management**: Results sized to fit available context window

### Performance Optimization for Context

**Query Pattern Optimization**:

```sql
-- Context queries prioritize recent, high-confidence entities
SELECT entities.*, similarity_score
FROM entities
JOIN semantic_search_results ON entities.id = semantic_search_results.entity_id
WHERE similarity_score >= 0.7
  AND (created_at > recent_threshold OR confidence > 0.8)
ORDER BY
  CASE WHEN created_at > recent_threshold
       THEN similarity_score * 1.2
       ELSE similarity_score END DESC
LIMIT adaptive_limit_based_on_token_budget
```

**Caching Strategy**:

- **Query Result Caching**: LRU cache for frequent context patterns
- **Embedding Caching**: Avoid re-encoding common queries
- **Graph Traversal Caching**: Pre-computed relationship paths
- **>70% hit rate** for typical agent workloads

### Multi-LLM Provider Support

Different LLM providers have different context requirements:

**OpenAI Integration**:

- Token estimation: ~4 characters per token
- Context formatting: Structured with clear sections
- Maximum context: 8K-128K tokens depending on model

**Anthropic Integration**:

- Token estimation: ~4.5 characters per token (slightly different)
- Context formatting: Conversational style preferred
- Maximum context: 32K-200K tokens depending on model

**Local Model Integration**:

- Token estimation: Provider-specific tokenization
- Context formatting: Simplified structure for smaller models
- Maximum context: 2K-8K tokens typically

## Performance Characteristics

## Troubleshooting Concepts

### Common Performance Issues

**Slow Semantic Search**:

- **Cause**: Large entity count without proper indexing
- **Solution**: Ensure vector indexes are built, consider result limits
- **Prevention**: Monitor entity growth and plan external migration

**High Memory Usage**:

- **Cause**: Large embedding cache or many concurrent connections
- **Solution**: Reduce cache size, limit connection pool
- **Prevention**: Set resource limits in configuration
