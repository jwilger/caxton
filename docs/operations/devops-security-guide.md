## Secure Deployment Configuration

### Production Security Settings

#### Essential Security Configuration

```bash
# Required environment variables for secure production deployment
export CAXTON_WASM_ISOLATION=strict
export CAXTON_FIPA_VALIDATION=enabled
export CAXTON_SECURITY_AUDIT=enabled
export CAXTON_LOG_LEVEL=info
export CAXTON_RESOURCE_LIMITS=production
```

#### WebAssembly Security Configuration

Caxton's security relies on WebAssembly isolation. Ensure strict isolation is enabled:

```yaml
# Example production configuration
wasm_config:
  isolation_mode: strict
  memory_limit_mb: 16
  cpu_time_limit_ms: 1000
  network_access: false
  filesystem_access: false
```

**Security Benefits:**

- Each agent runs in isolated WebAssembly sandbox
- Memory and CPU limits prevent resource exhaustion attacks
- No direct system access prevents privilege escalation
- Agent isolation prevents cross-contamination

### Message Security Configuration

Caxton uses FIPA-compliant messaging with built-in security validation:

```yaml
# Message security settings
fipa_config:
  message_validation: enabled
  max_message_size_kb: 1024
  conversation_timeout_minutes: 30
  content_sanitization: enabled
```

**Security Features:**

- All messages validated against FIPA protocol standards
- Size limits prevent denial-of-service attacks
- Conversation tracking prevents replay attacks
- Content sanitization blocks malicious payloads

## Container and Kubernetes Security

### Container Security Configuration

#### Secure Container Deployment

When deploying Caxton containers, ensure these security configurations:

```yaml
# Docker container security
version: '3.8'
services:
  caxton:
    image: caxton:latest
    user: "65534:65534"  # Non-root user
    read_only: true      # Read-only root filesystem
    cap_drop:
      - ALL              # Drop all capabilities
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp:noexec,nosuid,size=100m
```

**Container Security Features:**

- Runs as non-privileged user (nobody)
- Read-only root filesystem prevents tampering
- No container capabilities granted
- Temporary filesystem with security restrictions

#### Kubernetes Security

```yaml
# Kubernetes deployment security
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: caxton
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
        runAsUser: 65534
        runAsGroup: 65534
        fsGroup: 65534
      containers:
      - name: caxton
        securityContext:
          readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
          allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
          seccompProfile:
            type: RuntimeDefault
          capabilities:
            drop: ["ALL"]
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "200m"
          limits:
            memory: "2Gi"
            cpu: "1000m"
```

## Network Security

### Network Policies

Implement network segmentation using Kubernetes Network Policies:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: caxton-network-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: caxton
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: authorized-clients
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080
  egress:
  - to: []  # Restrict egress as needed
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 443  # HTTPS only
```

### TLS Configuration

Ensure all communications use TLS encryption:

```bash
# Generate TLS certificates for production
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096 \
  -keyout caxton.key -out caxton.crt \
  -subj "/CN=caxton.yourdomain.com"

# Configure Caxton with TLS
export CAXTON_TLS_CERT_PATH=/etc/ssl/certs/caxton.crt
export CAXTON_TLS_KEY_PATH=/etc/ssl/private/caxton.key
export CAXTON_TLS_ENABLED=true
```

## Security Monitoring and Operations

### Production Security Monitoring

Set up monitoring for these critical security indicators:

#### Essential Security Metrics

Monitor these key security health indicators:

- **Agent Isolation Status**: Verify WASM sandboxes are functioning
- **Message Validation Rate**: Track FIPA message validation success
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor CPU and memory consumption per agent
- **Authentication Events**: Log successful and failed authentication attempts
- **Network Activity**: Monitor inbound and outbound connections

#### Log Analysis

Configure log aggregation to detect security events:

```bash
# Example log queries for security monitoring
# Failed authentication attempts
grep "auth_failed" /var/log/caxton/security.log

# Resource limit violations
grep "resource_limit_exceeded" /var/log/caxton/security.log

# WASM isolation violations (critical)
grep "isolation_violation" /var/log/caxton/security.log
```

#### Alerting Configuration

Set up alerts for security incidents:

```yaml
# Example Prometheus alerting rules
groups:
- name: caxton_security
  rules:
  - alert: CaxtonIsolationViolation
    expr: caxton_isolation_violations_total > 0
    for: 0m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "WASM isolation violation detected"

  - alert: CaxtonAuthFailures
    expr: rate(caxton_auth_failures_total[5m]) > 10
    for: 2m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "High rate of authentication failures"
```

### Security Incident Response

#### Incident Classification

When security incidents occur, classify them quickly:

1. **P0 - Critical**: System compromise, data breach, isolation failure
2. **P1 - High**: Authentication bypass, privilege escalation
3. **P2 - Medium**: DoS attacks, information disclosure
4. **P3 - Low**: Security policy violations, configuration issues

#### Response Procedures

1. **Immediate**: Isolate affected components
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Containment**: Prevent further damage
4. **Recovery**: Restore secure operations
5. **Analysis**: Document lessons learned
