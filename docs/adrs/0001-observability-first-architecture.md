## Status

Accepted

## Context

Multi-agent systems are inherently complex, distributed, and non-deterministic.
When agents communicate asynchronously, debugging becomes extremely challenging:

- Traditional logging is insufficient - logs from different agents are
  interleaved and lack correlation
- Distributed tracing helps but needs to be built in from the start
- Reproducing issues is nearly impossible without understanding the exact
  sequence of interactions
- Performance bottlenecks are hard to identify without proper metrics

We need a server approach that makes agent systems observable and debuggable by
design, while remaining agnostic to how users choose to persist or analyze their
data.

## Decision

We will build observability into Caxton from the ground up using OpenTelemetry
standards, structured logging, and correlation tracking, while remaining
storage-agnostic.

Key aspects:

- Every message includes trace and span IDs for distributed tracing
- All log entries use structured format with consistent fields
- Correlation IDs link related messages across agents
- Metrics track performance at multiple levels (agent, message type, tool usage)
- The framework emits telemetry but doesn't mandate storage solutions
- Users can export to any OpenTelemetry-compatible backend

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Complete observability**: Every interaction can be traced and analyzed
- **Storage flexibility**: Users choose their own backends (Jaeger, Datadog,
  Honeycomb, etc.)
- **Industry standards**: OpenTelemetry is widely supported and understood
- **Performance insights**: Metrics help identify bottlenecks before they become
  problems
- **Debugging efficiency**: Correlation IDs make it easy to follow request flows
- **Production readiness**: Same observability in dev and production

### Negative

- **Initial complexity**: Developers must understand distributed tracing
  concepts
- **Performance overhead**: Telemetry collection adds some latency (typically \<
  1%)
- **Configuration burden**: Users must set up their own telemetry backends
- **Data volume**: High-cardinality traces can be expensive to store
- **Learning curve**: Teams need to learn effective debugging with traces

### Neutral

- **No built-in storage**: Framework doesn't include a database, which is both
  flexible and requires setup
- **Sampling decisions**: Users must configure sampling rates for
  cost/visibility trade-offs
- **Tool diversity**: Many backend options available, but no single "best"
  choice

## Implementation Considerations

The observability-first approach requires:

- **Trace context propagation**: All messages must carry distributed tracing
  identifiers to enable correlation across agents
- **Structured logging**: Consistent log fields across all components to enable
  effective querying and analysis
- **Automatic instrumentation**: Operations should be instrumented by default
  rather than requiring manual trace creation
- **Storage agnosticism**: The framework emits standard OpenTelemetry data that
  can be consumed by any compatible backend
