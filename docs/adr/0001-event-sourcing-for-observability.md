# 0001. Event Sourcing for Observability

Date: 2025-01-31

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Multi-agent systems are inherently complex, distributed, and non-deterministic. When agents communicate asynchronously, debugging becomes extremely challenging:

- Traditional logging is insufficient - logs from different agents are interleaved and lack causation information
- State-based debugging doesn't show how the system arrived at its current state  
- Distributed tracing helps but doesn't capture the full semantics of agent interactions
- Reproducing issues is nearly impossible without understanding the exact sequence of events

We need a foundational approach that makes agent systems observable and debuggable by design.

## Decision

We will use event sourcing as the core architectural pattern for Caxton, where every agent interaction is recorded as an immutable event in an append-only log.

Key aspects:
- Every message sent/received is an event
- Every tool invocation is an event
- Every agent state change is derived from events
- Events include correlation IDs for tracing conversations
- Events include causation IDs to understand why something happened
- The event log provides a global ordering for debugging

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Complete observability**: Every interaction is recorded and can be analyzed
- **Time-travel debugging**: Replay any conversation from any point in time
- **Natural audit trail**: Compliance and security monitoring built-in
- **Failure analysis**: When agents fail, the exact sequence leading to failure is preserved
- **Testing**: Can replay production event streams in test environments
- **Metrics**: All system metrics can be derived from the event stream

### Negative  

- **Storage overhead**: Every interaction requires persistent storage
- **Performance impact**: Event serialization and storage adds latency
- **Complexity**: Developers must understand event sourcing concepts
- **Privacy concerns**: Sensitive data in events needs careful handling
- **Event schema evolution**: Changing event formats requires migration strategies

### Mitigations

- Use efficient binary serialization (e.g., bincode) to minimize storage
- Implement event batching to amortize write costs
- Provide clear documentation and examples for event sourcing patterns
- Support event encryption and data retention policies
- Design events with forward compatibility in mind

## Alternatives Considered

### Traditional Logging
- **Pros**: Familiar, simple to implement
- **Cons**: Insufficient for understanding distributed conversations, no replay capability

### Distributed Tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- **Pros**: Industry standard, good tooling
- **Cons**: Focuses on performance, not semantic understanding of agent interactions

### State-based Debugging
- **Pros**: Simple mental model
- **Cons**: Doesn't show how state was reached, can't replay scenarios

### Hybrid Approach (Events + Logs)
- **Pros**: Best of both worlds
- **Cons**: Complexity of maintaining two systems, potential inconsistencies
