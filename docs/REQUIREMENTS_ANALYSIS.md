# Caxton Requirements Analysis

**Document Version**: 1.1
**Date**: 2025-09-16 (Updated from 2025-09-14)
**Status**: Updated - Deployment Model Clarification
**Product Manager**: product-manager

## Important Clarification (2025-09-16)

**Deployment Model Change**: The original "hot reload" requirement has been
clarified to mean **manual deployment commands**, not automatic file watching.
The intended developer workflow is:

1. **Start Server**: `caxton serve` (runs continuously)
2. **Edit Configurations**: Modify agent TOML files in workspace
3. **Deploy Changes**: `caxton deploy` (explicit push to server)
4. **Fast Iteration**: Incremental deployment of only changed configurations

This aligns with container/Kubernetes deployment patterns where developers have
explicit control over when changes go live, rather than automatic file watching
behavior typical of development servers.

## Executive Summary

Caxton is an agent orchestration application server that enables developers to
create, deploy, and manage AI agents within 5-10 minutes. The platform
eliminates platform lock-in, provides intelligent capability-based routing
between agents, and ensures security through WebAssembly sandboxing for
third-party tools. This document defines comprehensive functional requirements,
user stories, and acceptance criteria that will guide the system's development.

## Vision Statement

**For** developers building AI-powered applications
**Who** need rapid agent deployment without infrastructure complexity
**The** Caxton platform
**Is** an agent orchestration server
**That** provides configuration-driven agents with intelligent routing and
secure tool execution
**Unlike** platform-specific solutions requiring hours of setup
**Our product** enables functional multi-agent systems in 5-10 minutes with
zero external dependencies

## Core Problems Being Solved

### 1. Platform Lock-in

**Problem**: Current agent platforms tie developers to specific cloud providers
or frameworks
**Impact**: Increased costs, reduced flexibility, vendor dependency risks
**Solution**: Platform-agnostic application server that runs anywhere

### 2. Complex Agent Communication

**Problem**: Direct agent-to-agent communication requires hardcoded routing and
tight coupling
**Impact**: Brittle systems, difficult maintenance, poor scalability
**Solution**: Capability-based intelligent routing that decouples agents

### 3. Security and Sandboxing

**Problem**: Third-party tools accessing external systems pose security risks
**Impact**: Data breaches, resource exhaustion, compliance violations
**Solution**: WebAssembly MCP servers providing secure sandboxed execution

- Agent templates for common patterns
- Multiple MCP tools
- Performance optimizations

### Post-MVP Priority

1. **Memory System**: Semantic search and graph traversal
2. **Advanced Routing**: Load balancing and failover
3. **Enterprise Features**: RBAC, audit logging, compliance
4. **Scaling**: Multi-node deployment options

## Dependencies and Risks

### Technical Dependencies

## Handoff to Event Modeling Phase

This requirements analysis provides the foundation for collaborative Event
Modeling. The next phase requires:

1. **Participants**: product-manager, technical-architect, ux-ui-design-expert
2. **Goal**: Create comprehensive EVENT_MODEL.md following eventmodeling.org
   methodology
3. **Focus Areas**:
   - User workflows from requirements
   - System events and state transitions
   - Command/query boundaries
   - Read model projections

Key workflows to model:

- Agent deployment and configuration flow
- Message routing and capability discovery
- MCP tool execution with sandboxing
- Memory storage and retrieval (post-MVP design)
- System monitoring and administration

The Event Model will translate these functional requirements into a visual
timeline showing how the system evolves through user interactions and system
events.
