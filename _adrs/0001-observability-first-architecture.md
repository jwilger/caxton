# 0001. Observability-First Architecture

Date: 2025-01-31

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Multi-agent systems are inherently complex, distributed, and non-deterministic. When agents communicate asynchronously, debugging becomes extremely challenging:

- Traditional logging is insufficient - logs from different agents are interleaved and lack correlation
- Distributed tracing helps but needs to be built in from the start
- Reproducing issues is nearly impossible without understanding the exact sequence of interactions
- Performance bottlenecks are hard to identify without proper metrics

We need a foundational approach that makes agent systems observable and debuggable by design, while remaining agnostic to how users choose to persist or analyze their data.

## Decision

We will build observability into Caxton from the ground up using OpenTelemetry standards, structured logging, and correlation tracking, while remaining storage-agnostic.

Key aspects:
- Every message includes trace and span IDs for distributed tracing
- All log entries use structured format with consistent fields
- Correlation IDs link related messages across agents
- Metrics track performance at multiple levels (agent, message type, tool usage)
- The framework emits telemetry but doesn't mandate storage solutions
- Users can export to any OpenTelemetry-compatible backend

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Complete observability**: Every interaction can be traced and analyzed
- **Storage flexibility**: Users choose their own backends (Jaeger, Datadog, Honeycomb, etc.)
- **Industry standards**: OpenTelemetry is widely supported and understood
- **Performance insights**: Metrics help identify bottlenecks before they become problems
- **Debugging efficiency**: Correlation IDs make it easy to follow request flows
- **Production readiness**: Same observability in dev and production

### Negative  

- **Initial complexity**: Developers must understand distributed tracing concepts
- **Performance overhead**: Telemetry collection adds some latency (typically < 1%)
- **Configuration burden**: Users must set up their own telemetry backends
- **Data volume**: High-cardinality traces can be expensive to store
- **Learning curve**: Teams need to learn effective debugging with traces

### Neutral

- **No built-in storage**: Framework doesn't include a database, which is both flexible and requires setup
- **Sampling decisions**: Users must configure sampling rates for cost/visibility trade-offs
- **Tool diversity**: Many backend options available, but no single "best" choice

## Implementation Notes

```rust
// Every message automatically includes tracing context
pub struct FipaMessage {
    pub id: MessageId,
    pub trace_id: TraceId,
    pub span_id: SpanId,
    pub correlation_id: CorrelationId,
    // ... other fields
}

// Structured logging with consistent fields
info!(
    agent_id = %agent.id,
    message_type = msg.performative(),
    correlation_id = %msg.correlation_id,
    duration_ms = elapsed.as_millis(),
    "Message processed successfully"
);

// Automatic span creation for operations
#[instrument(skip(self, msg))]
pub async fn handle_message(&self, msg: FipaMessage) -> Result<(), Error> {
    // Implementation automatically traced
}
```
