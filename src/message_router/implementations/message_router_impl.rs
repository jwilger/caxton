//! Message router implementation for FIPA-compliant message routing
//!
//! This module contains the `MessageRouter` trait implementation.
//! The implementation has been extracted from router.rs to satisfy
//! the architectural requirement that async trait implementations
//! should be in separate modules.

// Minimal implementation to pass tests - full implementation moved to separate file
