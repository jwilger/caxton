# Architecture Decision Records

Welcome to our collection of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). These documents capture the important architectural decisions made during the development of Caxton, including the context, reasoning, and consequences of each decision.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are short documents that capture a single architecture decision and its rationale. They help us:

- **Document the reasoning** behind important technical decisions
- **Provide context** for future developers and stakeholders  
- **Track the evolution** of our architectural thinking
- **Avoid revisiting** settled questions

## How to Read ADRs

Each ADR follows a consistent format:

- **Status**: Current state (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
- **Context**: The situation that led to this decision
- **Decision**: What we decided to do
- **Consequences**: The positive and negative impacts of this decision

## Browse by Status

- **Proposed**: Under consideration
- **Accepted**: Currently in effect
- **Deprecated**: No longer recommended
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer decision

*ADRs are living documents. They may be updated as we learn more or as circumstances change.*
