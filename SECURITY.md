# Security Policy

## Overview

Caxton is a multi-agent orchestration platform that prioritizes security through WebAssembly isolation, FIPA protocol validation, and comprehensive observability. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting procedures, and security guarantees.

## Security Architecture

### WebAssembly Isolation

Caxton uses WebAssembly (WASM) as a fundamental security boundary:

- **Memory Isolation**: Each agent runs in a separate WASM instance with isolated linear memory
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable memory and CPU time limits prevent resource exhaustion
- **System Call Restrictions**: WASM sandbox prevents direct system access
- **Capability-Based Security**: Agents can only access explicitly granted capabilities

```rust
// Example: Strict isolation configuration for production
IsolationConfig::strict() {
    memory_limit_bytes: Some(16 * 1024 * 1024), // 16MB
    cpu_time_limit_ms: Some(1000),              // 1 second
    network_access: false,
    filesystem_access: false,
}
```

### FIPA Message Security

All inter-agent communication uses validated FIPA messages:

- **Message Validation**: All messages are parsed and validated before processing
- **Conversation Tracking**: Deterministic conversation IDs prevent replay attacks
- **Content Sanitization**: Message content is sanitized based on content type
- **Size Limits**: Messages have configurable size limits to prevent DoS attacks

### Observability-First Security

- **Structured Logging**: All security events are logged with structured data
- **Distributed Tracing**: Security-relevant operations are traced end-to-end
- **Metrics Collection**: Security metrics are collected and monitored
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit trail of all agent interactions

## Security Guarantees

### Agent Isolation

1. **Memory Safety**: Agents cannot access each other's memory or host system memory
2. **Resource Limits**: Agents cannot consume more resources than allocated
3. **System Boundaries**: Agents cannot make unauthorized system calls
4. **Network Isolation**: Agents cannot make unauthorized network connections

### Message Security

1. **Validation**: All messages are validated against FIPA protocol standards
2. **Integrity**: Message integrity is maintained through the entire processing pipeline
3. **Authentication**: Message senders are authenticated through agent lifecycle management
4. **Non-repudiation**: All messages are logged with sender identification

### Platform Security

1. **Least Privilege**: Components run with minimal required privileges
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers prevent single points of failure
3. **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Secure defaults are used throughout the system
4. **Security Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring detects security anomalies

## Threat Model

### In Scope

- Malicious WASM modules
- Resource exhaustion attacks
- Message injection/tampering
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service attacks

### Out of Scope

- Physical security of host systems
- Network infrastructure security
- Operating system vulnerabilities
- Third-party service vulnerabilities

## Security Controls

### Development Security

- **Secure Coding**: Rust memory safety prevents common vulnerability classes
- **Dependency Management**: All dependencies are audited for known vulnerabilities
- **Static Analysis**: Code is analyzed with Clippy and additional security lints
- **Testing**: Comprehensive security testing including fuzzing and property-based tests

### Build Security

- **Reproducible Builds**: Container images are built reproducibly with SBOMs
- **Supply Chain Security**: All dependencies are verified and pinned
- **Container Hardening**: Containers run as non-root with minimal attack surface
- **Image Scanning**: Container images are scanned for vulnerabilities

### Runtime Security

- **Resource Monitoring**: Runtime resource usage is monitored and limited
- **Network Policies**: Strict network policies limit communication
- **Security Contexts**: Containers run with restrictive security contexts
- **Audit Logging**: All security-relevant events are logged and monitored

## Vulnerability Management

### Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them by emailing security@caxton.dev or through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature.

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested remediation (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Detailed Response**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Timeline**: Varies by severity (see below)

### Severity Classification

#### Critical (Fix within 24 hours)
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Data exfiltration
- Complete system compromise

#### High (Fix within 1 week)
- Privilege escalation
- Denial of service
- Information disclosure
- Security control bypass

#### Medium (Fix within 1 month)
- Less severe information disclosure
- Limited privilege escalation
- Security feature weakness

#### Low (Fix in next release)
- Security hardening opportunities
- Defense-in-depth improvements
- Minor information leaks

### Security Update Process

1. **Validation**: Vulnerability is validated and assessed
2. **Fix Development**: Security fix is developed and tested
3. **Security Review**: Fix undergoes security review
4. **Release Preparation**: Release notes and advisories are prepared
5. **Coordinated Disclosure**: Fix is released with security advisory
6. **Post-Release**: Monitoring for successful deployment

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:

- **Security Audit**: `cargo audit` checks for known vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Static Analysis**: Security-focused static analysis tools
- **Container Scanning**: Vulnerability scanning of container images
- **Fuzzing**: Automated fuzzing of critical security components

### Manual Testing

Regular manual security testing includes:

- **Penetration Testing**: External security assessments
- **Code Review**: Security-focused code reviews
