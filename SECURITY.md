## Overview

Caxton is a multi-agent orchestration platform that prioritizes security through WebAssembly isolation, FIPA protocol validation, and comprehensive observability. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting procedures, and security guarantees.

## Security Architecture

### WebAssembly Isolation

Caxton uses WebAssembly (WASM) as a fundamental security boundary:

- **Memory Isolation**: Each agent runs in a separate WASM instance with isolated linear memory
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable memory and CPU time limits prevent resource exhaustion
- **System Call Restrictions**: WASM sandbox prevents direct system access
- **Capability-Based Security**: Agents can only access explicitly granted capabilities

```rust
// Example: Strict isolation configuration for production
IsolationConfig::strict() {
    memory_limit_bytes: Some(16 * 1024 * 1024), // 16MB
    cpu_time_limit_ms: Some(1000),              // 1 second
    network_access: false,
    filesystem_access: false,
}
```

### FIPA Message Security

All inter-agent communication uses validated FIPA messages:

- **Message Validation**: All messages are parsed and validated before processing
- **Conversation Tracking**: Deterministic conversation IDs prevent replay attacks
- **Content Sanitization**: Message content is sanitized based on content type
- **Size Limits**: Messages have configurable size limits to prevent DoS attacks

### Observability-First Security

- **Structured Logging**: All security events are logged with structured data
- **Distributed Tracing**: Security-relevant operations are traced end-to-end
- **Metrics Collection**: Security metrics are collected and monitored
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit trail of all agent interactions

## Security Guarantees

### Agent Isolation

1. **Memory Safety**: Agents cannot access each other's memory or host system memory
2. **Resource Limits**: Agents cannot consume more resources than allocated
3. **System Boundaries**: Agents cannot make unauthorized system calls
4. **Network Isolation**: Agents cannot make unauthorized network connections

### Message Security

1. **Validation**: All messages are validated against FIPA protocol standards
2. **Integrity**: Message integrity is maintained through the entire processing pipeline
3. **Authentication**: Message senders are authenticated through agent lifecycle management
4. **Non-repudiation**: All messages are logged with sender identification

### Platform Security

1. **Least Privilege**: Components run with minimal required privileges
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers prevent single points of failure
3. **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Secure defaults are used throughout the system
4. **Security Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring detects security anomalies

## Threat Model

### In Scope

- Malicious WASM modules
- Resource exhaustion attacks
- Message injection/tampering
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service attacks

### Out of Scope

- Physical security of host systems
- Network infrastructure security
- Operating system vulnerabilities
- Third-party service vulnerabilities

## Security Controls

### Development Security

- **Secure Coding**: Rust memory safety prevents common vulnerability classes
- **Dependency Management**: All dependencies are audited for known vulnerabilities using `cargo-deny`
- **Static Analysis**: Code is analyzed with Clippy and additional security lints
- **Testing**: Comprehensive security testing including fuzzing and property-based tests

#### Cargo-Deny Integration

[Cargo-deny](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny) provides comprehensive dependency security validation:

```bash
# Install cargo-deny for security auditing
cargo install cargo-deny

# Run complete security audit
cargo deny check

# Check specific categories
cargo deny check advisories    # Vulnerability scanning
cargo deny check licenses      # License compliance
cargo deny check bans          # Dependency policies
cargo deny check sources       # Supply chain security
```

**Security Policy Configuration:**
Our `deny.toml` configuration enforces:
- **Zero tolerance for vulnerabilities** in runtime dependencies (enhanced beyond cargo audit)
- **Approved license whitelist** for enterprise compliance
- **Supply chain validation** restricting to crates.io registry
- **Dependency hygiene** warnings for multiple versions and maintenance status

**Migration from cargo audit**: We've evolved from basic `cargo audit` vulnerability checking to comprehensive `cargo deny` policy enforcement for enterprise-grade security validation.

See [deny.toml](deny.toml) for complete configuration details.

### Build Security

- **Reproducible Builds**: Container images are built reproducibly with SBOMs
- **Supply Chain Security**: All dependencies are verified and pinned
- **Container Hardening**: Containers run as non-root with minimal attack surface
- **Image Scanning**: Container images are scanned for vulnerabilities

### Runtime Security

- **Resource Monitoring**: Runtime resource usage is monitored and limited
- **Network Policies**: Strict network policies limit communication
- **Security Contexts**: Containers run with restrictive security contexts
- **Audit Logging**: All security-relevant events are logged and monitored

## Vulnerability Management

### Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

```yaml
# Kubernetes security context
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 65534
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  capabilities:
    drop: ["ALL"]
```

```rust
// Caxton security configuration
CaxtonConfig {
    wasm_isolation: IsolationConfig::strict(),
    fipa_validation: true,
    security_audit_logs: true,
    resource_limits: ResourceLimits::production(),
    observability: ObservabilityConfig::security_focused(),
}
```

### Environment Variables

Security-related environment variables:

- `CAXTON_WASM_ISOLATION=strict`: Enable strict WASM isolation (see [WebAssembly Isolation](#webassembly-isolation))
- `CAXTON_FIPA_VALIDATION=enabled`: Enable FIPA message validation (see [FIPA Message Security](#fipa-message-security))
- `CAXTON_SECURITY_AUDIT=enabled`: Enable security audit logging (see [Observability-First Security](#observability-first-security))

### Integrated Security Workflow

Caxton's security architecture integrates multiple layers:

1. **Development Phase**: [Cargo-deny](#cargo-deny-integration) validates dependencies before deployment
2. **Build Phase**: [CI security checks](#ci-security-workflow) prevent vulnerable code from merging
3. **Runtime Phase**: [WebAssembly isolation](#webassembly-isolation) and [FIPA validation](#fipa-message-security) protect against runtime threats
4. **Monitoring Phase**: [Observability](#observability-first-security) provides continuous security visibility
5. **Response Phase**: [RFC 9116 security.txt](#rfc-9116-securitytxt-best-practices) enables coordinated vulnerability disclosure

This defense-in-depth approach ensures security at every stage of the software lifecycle."
